# Excel-Multithreading-VBA-

A modification of the Whac-A-Mole repository, to illustrate multithreading in Excel. Basically, we have two Do Loops running at the same time, independently - one from VBA and one from the VBScript. The former Do loop is handling the movement of the moles and the latter one is moving the hammer image onto the mouse cursor.

**Keep the hammer.vbs file in the same location as the Whack-A-Mole_Multithreading.xlsm file.**
